# eFramework

[中文文档](../zh/README.md)

**eFramework** is a micro-framework service, which is the learning outcome, the author hopes to learn a whole set of related knowledge about microservices by writing such a framework. Therefore, in the process of writing, in addition to what is necessary, reference the third-party library as little as possible, but choose to imitate it by yourself to achieve the purpose of learning. The framework has not been tested in the production environment at present, and readers are welcome to use it and provide feedback. I hope that readers can achieve the purpose of learning and mastering the knowledge of microservices by reading **eFramework**. Thanks!
